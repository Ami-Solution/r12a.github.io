<section>
<p>A key aim here is to allow you to switch from map to map and see how boundaries evolve across an unchanging background.</p>
<p>The information in the maps linked to below is derived mostly from information in Colin McEvedy's excellent series of  books, in particular (so far) <cite>The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History</cite>, but also sometimes brings in information from the <cite>Times History of Europe</cite>. Boundaries are approximate for a number of reasons: first, in the earlier times especially, the borders were only approximate anyway, second, I have deduced the boundary information from small-scale maps and (so far) only a little additional research, third, the sources sometimes differ about where boundaries lay. I hope to refine the data during future research, in the meantime take this information as <em>grosso modo</em>.</p>
<p>The large links below open an SVG map in a separate window. The commentary on this page fills in information about the major historical changes, in chronological order, as you move from one map to another. I suggest that you open both windows side by side, if you are able.</p>
<p>The background to the SVG overlay is a (bit)map that shows relief and rivers, as well as modern country boundaries (the dark lines). These were things which, as good as McEvedy's maps were, I was always missing in order to get useful reference points. The map by Tubs is available from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BLANK_in_Europe_%28relief%29_%28-mini_map%29.svg">Wikimedia commons</a>. (At some point I'll try to integrate the SVG version.)</p>

<p>In the first map the Roman Empire is in full swing, with the Teutonic tribes in the East, and the Slavs, Balts and Finns beyond them. In the south-east we see the Persian Empire, and to the far east, the Huns are beginning to make an appearance.</p>

<p><span class="date">364</span> Julian's expedition against Persia. He is killed and his successor signs away the eastern half of Roman Mesopotamia and the overlordship of Ibera and Armenia.</p>
<p><span class="date">372</span> Eastward expansion of the Ostrogoths creates a reaction from the Huns, who destroy every force sent against them by Ermanarich, the Ostrogoth king. The Huns push forward to the Danube, crushing the Visigoths and enslaving the Gepids. Many Goths apply to the Roman Empire for sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class="date">378</span>The Visigoths revolt against the Romans sheltering them. While attacking them, the Roman Emperor is outflanked by Ostrogoths and killed with most of his staff. Rome begins recruiting more barbarians to bring their army up to date.</p>
<p><span class="date">387</span> Persia returns the Western fifth of Armenia for clear title to the remainder.</p>
<p><span class="date">395</span> The Visigoths revolt again under King Alaric and are offered land in Epirus.</p>

<p><span class="date">402</span> Stilicho bundles the Visigoths back into Illyria.</p>
<p><span class="date">405</span> Stilicho defeats a coalition of Ostrogoths, Quadi and Asding Vandals descending on Italy from the North.</p>
<p><span class="date">406</span> Entire tribes begin moving westwards, presumably to avoid harrassment by the Huns. In particular, this includes the Quadi and Marcomanni, known collectively as the Suevi, as well as the Asding and Siling Vandals and a clan of Alans from the Caucasus. On the last day of 406 the lead elements cross the Rhine into Gaul.</p>

<p><span class="date">410</span> Alaric the Visigoth obtains a ransom for Rome and sets up a puppet emperor, but is unable to remove Honorius from Ravenna. He then sacks Rome. Alaric then travels to the toe of Italy to get access to the Africa grain-growing areas, but has no boats to get to Sicily. He turns around, but dies shortly after.</p>
<p><span class="date">411</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain  is killed by Romans and Britain falls out of the Empire. The Alans, Vandals and Suevi have moved on to Spain.</p>

The Burgundians take the Rhone valley from the Romans, and the Franks and Alemanni divide the north-east between them. British chieftains flee to Brittany. Otherwise, the north-west is held by the Roman patrician, Syagrius.</p>
<p><span class="date">475</span> The Ostrogoths invade the Balkans in 475, then reoccupy the old Visigothic settlement along the lower Danube.</p>

<p><span class="date">540</span> The Ostrogothic king surrenders his crown and capital to Belisarius. Belisarius sails home, but the Goths north of the River Po fight back until the Romans are unable to keep much more than Ravenna.</p>
<p><span class="date">552</span> Justinian sends another army with Narses through Dalmatia, where they are joined by 5,000 Lombards. The Mongolian empire of the Jouan-Jouan is defeated by Turkic tribes, and they head westward.</p>

<p>The Avars also push the Saxons to the west of the Elbe, and cause the Franks to abandon east Thuringia and the Bavarians Bohemia. The vacated territories were filled by Slav tribes.</p>
<p>At some point, the Turks in the east pressed the Avars as far as the Crimea, but then mostly departed, leaving the Alans and Utigur Huns with a degree of freedom from the Avars.</p>
