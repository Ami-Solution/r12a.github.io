<p>The maps linked to below are derived mostly from information in Colin McEvedy's excellent series of  books, starting with <cite>The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History</cite>, but also sometimes brings in information from the <cite>Times History of Europe</cite>. Boundaries are approximate for a number of reasons: first, in the earlier times especially, the borders were only approximate anyway, second, I have deduced the boundary information from small-scale maps and little additional research, third, the sources sometimes differ about where boundaries lay. I may refine the information during future research.</p>
<p>The large links below take you to an SVG map. The commentary fills in information about the major historical changes as you move from one map to another.</p>
<p>The background to the SVG overlay is a map that shows relief and rivers, as well as modern country boundaries (the dark lines). These were things which, as good as McEvedy's maps were, I was always missing in order to get useful reference points.</p>

<h2><a href="#ad362">The Medieval period</a></h2>
<p>In the first map the Roman Empire is in full swing, with the Teutonic tribes in the East, and the Slavs, Balts and Finns beyond them. In the South-East we see the Persian Empire, and to the far East, the Huns are beginning to make an appearance.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_362.svg" target="maps">362 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">364</span> Julian's expedition against Persia. He is killed and his successor signs away the eastern half of Roman Mesopotamia and the overlordship of Ibera and Armenia.</p>
<p><span class="date">372</span> Eastward expansion of the Ostrogoths creates a reaction from the Huns, who destroy every force sent against them by Ermanarich. The Huns push forward to the Danube, crushing the Visigoths and enslaving the Gepids. Many Goths apply to the Roman Empire for sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class="date">378</span>The Visigoths revolt against the Romans sheltering them. While attacking them, the Roman Emperor is outflanked by Ostrogoths and killed with most of his staff. Rome begins recruiting more barbarians to bring their army up to date.</p>
<p><span class="date">387</span> Persia returns the Western fifth of Armenia for clear title to the remainder.</p>
<p><span class="date">395</span> The Visigoths revolt again under King Alaric and are offered land in Epirus.</p>
<p><span class="date">401</span> Alaric leads the Visigoths against the Western Roman Empire, but is met by the Roman general Stilicho (a Vandal).</p>
<p><span class="date">402</span> Stilicho bundles the Visigoths back into Illyria.</p>
<p><span class="date">405</span> Stilicho defeats a coalition of Ostrogoths, Quadi and Asding Vandals descending on Italy from the North.</p>
<p><span class="date">406</span> Entire tribes begin moving westwards, presumably to avoid harrassment by the Huns. In particular, this includes the Quadi and Marcomanni, known collectively as the Suevi, as well as the Asding and Siling Vandals and a clan of Alans from the Caucasus. On the last day of 406 the lead elements cross the Rhine into Gaul.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_406.svg" target="maps">406 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">407</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain crosses the channel to reinforce his imperial claim, but doesn't engage the advancing German tribes, nor the Franks, Burgundians and Alemanni, who take land on the left of the Rhine.</p>
<p><span class="date">408</span> Stilicho is murdered on the orders of Emperor Honorius.</p>
<p><span class="date">410</span> Alaric the Visigoth obtains a ransom for Rome and sets up a puppet emperor, but is unable to remove Honorius from Ravenna. He then sacks Rome. Alaric then travels to the toe of Italy to get access to the Africa grain-growing areas, but has no boats to get to Sicily. He turns around, but dies shortly after.</p>
<p><span class="date">411</span> The leader of the Roman garrison in Britain  is killed by Romans and Britain falls out of the Empire. The Alans, Vandals and Suevi have moved on to Spain.</p>
<p><span class="date">412</span> Led by Athaulf, Alaric's successor, the Visigoths arrive in southern Gaul, but again need supplies. They agree to clear Spain of the Suevi and Vandals in return for lands in Gaul.</p>
<p><span class="date">416</span> The Visigoths push the Suevi and Vandals into the north-west corner of the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p><span class="date">418</span> The Visigoths arrive in south-west Gaul and set up a kingdom as foederatii.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_406.svg" target="maps">420 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">429</span> The Asding Vandals join with the Siling Vandals and Alans that remain in the south of Iberia and 80,000 people cross to North Africa under King Gaiseric.</p>
<p><span class="date">433-444</span> Attila the Hun unites the Hun tribes under his rule, then begins raids, supported by Ostrogoths and Gepids. He pushes the boundary of the Eastern Roman Empire south of the Danube.</p>
<p><span class="date">435</span> The Romans cede the western African provinces to King Gaiseric.</p>
<p><span class="date">436</span> Attila destroys the Burgundian capital of Worms, and they flee to Savoy. He then tightens his grip on the Alemanni, the Franks of the Rhine valley, and the Thuringians.</p>
<p><span class="date">439</span>  King Gaiseric seizes Carthage.</p>
<p><span class="date">442</span> The Romans allow King Gaiseric to exchange the western African provinces for the central zone, equivalent to modern Tunisia.</p>
<p><span class="date">449</span> After raids by Picts, Irish, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, the Jutes begin a permanent settlement in the south-east of Britain.</p>
<p><span class="date">451</span> Attila invades Gaul. He is pushed back from Orleans by the Roman general Aetius, supported by Visigoths, Burgundians and Franks, and retreats from Campus Mauriacus in the Seine valley.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_451.svg" target="maps">451 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">452</span> Attila dies and his empire is destroyed by a German revolt, led by the Gepids at the Nedao river in Hungary. </p>
<p><span class="date">455</span> After taking the Balearic, Corsican, Sardinian islands and Sicily, Gaiseric sacks Rome. He later relinquishes most of Sicily to Odoacer.</p>
<p><span class="date">470</span> Kutrigur and Utigur remnants of Attila's empire contest lands in the Russian steppe.</p>
<p><span class="date">470s</span> The Visigoths push their Gallic boundaries towards the Rhone and Loire, and take over most of Iberia, other than the lands occupied by the Suevi and the Basques.  The Burgundians take the Rhone valley from the Romans, and the Franks and Alemanni divide the north-east between them. British chieftains flee to Brittany. Otherwise, the north-west is held by the Roman patrician, Syagrius.</p>
<p><span class="date">475</span> The Ostrogoths invade the Balkans in 475, then reoccupy the old Visigothic settlement along the lower Danube.</p>
<p><span class="date">476</span> The German general Odoacer takes control of what becomes the Kingdom of Italy, and the emperor Romulus Augustus is dismissed.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_476.svg" target="maps">476 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">480</span> Julius Nepos, who fled to Dalmatia where his authority as (puppet) Emperor is recognized, dies. Odoacer incorporates that piece of the former Western Roman Empire into his Kingdom of Italy.</p>
<p><span class="date">486</span> After successfully making himself the sole king of the Franks, Clovis of Tournai drives Syagrius from the Roman quarter of Gaul and incorporates the land into his territory.</p>
<p><span class="date">487</span> Odoacer crushes the Rugians so completely after they cross the Danube that they vanish from history. Their place is taken by the Bavarians, a confederacy of Suevic remnants.</p>
<p><span class="date">493</span> Encouraged by the Eastern Roman Empire, Theodoric leads the Ostrogoths against the Kingdom of Italy and defeats them, replacing them with the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p><span class="date">496</span> Clovis defeats the Alemanni.</p>
<p><span class="date">505</span> Clovis defeats the Alemanni again, and takes them and their territory into his domain.</p>
<p><span class="date">507</span> Clovis defeats the Visigoths and takes over nearly all the Visigothic lands north of the Pyrenees. Theodoric the Ostrogoth restrains Burgundian expansion, annexes Provence and puts Septimania under his protection, preserving it for the Visigoths.</p>
<p><span class="date">511</span> Clovis dies, to by replaced by four kings ruling the Frankish Realm. The Visigoths give the crown of the West Gothic realm to Theodoric, although in practice the two kingdoms continue to operate independently. The Vandals also give up their toe-hold on Sicily.</p>
<p><span class="date">523+</span> The Irish begin to invade Britain, where they are known as Scots.</p>
<p><span class="date">527</span> Justinian becomes emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire and dedicates himself to the reconquest of the West.</p>
<p><a class="maplink" href="svg/AD_528.svg" target="maps">528 <span class="era">AD</span></a></p>
<p><span class="date">531</span> The Franks annex Thuringia.</p>
<p><span class="date">533</span> Justinian's general Belisarius captures Carthage while the Vandal king is in Sardinia, then defeats the king when he returns.</p>
<p><span class="date">534</span> The Franks subjugate Burgundy.</p>
<p><span class="date">536</span> Surprised by the ease with which they recovered Sicily, Belisarius leads a small army up the peninsula to Rome and lays siege to the city. The Franks take Provence and the central Alps from the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p><span class="date">540</span> The Ostrogothic king surrenders his crown and capital to Belisarius. Belisarius sails home, but the Goths north of the River Po fight back until the Romans are unable to keep much more than Ravenna.</p>
<p><span class="date">552</span> Justinian sends another army with Narses through Dalmatia, where they are joined by 5,000 Lombards. The Mongolian empire of the Jouan-Jouan is defeated by Turkic tribes, and they head westward.</p>
<p><span class="date">553</span>  Narses annihilates the Ostrogoth army between Ravenna and Rome. The Bavarians and Lombards profit from this to expand their territory below the Danube, during which the Bavarians accept a measure of Frankish suzerainty.</p>
<p><span class="date">554</span> A civil war in Iberia gives Justinian an opportunity to seize the south-east part of the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p><span class="date">557</span> The Turks defeat the White Huns in Transoxiana, and the latter join the remnants of the Jouan-Jouan north of the Caspian, from where the Turks inflict another defeat that sends the further west, where they are known as the Avars.</p>
<p><span class="date">559-561</span> After incitement by Justinian to attach the Huns and Slavs of the Russian steppes, the Avars subjugate all the tribes between the Volga and the Danube.</p>
<p><span class="date">562</span> The Avars attack Thuringia.</p>
