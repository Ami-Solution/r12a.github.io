        <p class="mainPicture"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-charuse/"><img src="imgs/charuse.png" alt="Picture of the app in action."></a></p>
        <p>A new <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/app-charuse/">Character usage lookup</a> web app is now available.  It draws on data sources (initially CLDR and Unicode's UDHR pages, with additional information from Wikipedia) to associate characters with a range of languages (440 at the moment). The app lets you find characters used by a particular language, or languages that use a given non-ASCII character.</p>
<p> ASCII characters are ignored.     Only the core characters from CLDR are shown (not the auxiliary), but every character that appears in a UDHR transcription is shown. Going forward, I expect to add information from other sources. Characters shown for a language include all characters produced by applying uppercase, lowercase, NFC, and NFD to the set of characters attributed to that language by its source.          Chinese languages, Japanese, and Korean are not listed.</p>
<p>The <samp>Native speakers</samp> column indicates the estimated number of <em>native</em> speakers for all the languages listed, in order to give a rough idea of the prevalence of that character. It doesn't represent the number of people who speak it as a second language, and often that is a multiple of the native speaker total. However, this number also represents speakers rather than literate users, so they are <em>potential</em> users of the character. Depending on the language, therefore, the figures may be low or at least conservative for speakers of many languages, and possibly high for speakers of some languages (typically small languages, or when using an alternate orthography).</p>
          <p>The following tips may be useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mouse over the characters displayed to see their Unicode code point value and name. The <samp>U</samp> icon will show all characters in that cell in UniView. This can be useful if you don't have fonts for that script, since UniView uses images by default.</li>
  <li> The control <samp>Use language name</samp> works as follows: Type in a name, or part of a name, of a language. Select the language you want from the suggestions offered. This will put the BCP47 code into the control. Hit return and you'll display information for that language.<br>
Unfortunately, this doesn't work with Safari, or (therefore)  iOS. If you need to find a BCP47 code for a language, go to <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/">https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/</a>.</li>
  <li>When adding characters you want to look up to the input field, you can add Unicode code point numbers with space to either side, or escapes. For example, for આ any of the following escapes will work: <code>&amp;#x0A86; \u0A86 \u{A86} \0A86 U+0A86 0xA86</code>. No extra space is needed between escapes, and supplementary characters work too.</li>
  <li>After you have generated a list of languages that use a given character, if you click on a language name then details for that language will be displayed above.</li>
</ul>

        <p>The <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/apps/listcharacters/">List characters</a> web app lets you find out what characters are contained in some text. Simply drop the text into the large box and click <samp>Analyse the text above</samp>. The result is grouped by Unicode blocks.</p>
<p>This update adds three new buttons: <samp>Convert to NFC</samp>, <samp>Convert to NFD</samp>, and <samp>Get all forms</samp>. The first two buttons are self-explanatory if you are familiar with Unicode Normalization forms. (If not, <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/part3#normalization">see the explanation</a> in my Unicode tutorial.)</p>
<p>The third button makes four copies of the text, and to each applies one of the following:  (1) all lowercase, (2) all uppercase, (3) all NFC, and (4) all NFD. When you then hit the <samp>Analyse the text above</samp> button you get far more results, as shown in the picture above, which shows what the same (Vietnamese) text produces before and after using this new button.</p>
<p>There is also a new line showing the total number of unique characters in the text.</p>

        <p>A new <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/makasar/">Makasar Character Picker</a> web app is now available. The Makassar script was used formerly for the Makassarese language and will be added to the Unicode Standard in version 11. The script is sometimes called Makassarese Bird Script or Old Makassarese.</p>
<p>The picker allows you to produce or analyse 
            runs of  text using the Makasar script. Character pickers are 
            especially useful for people who don’t know a script well, as characters
            are arranged in ways that aid identification.</p>
          <p>Apart from the standard functions, the <samp>Makasar to Latin</samp> selector above the text area converts the content of the text area (or the highlighted text) to a Latin transliteration. Note that this is unable to capture geminated consonant sounds, syllable-final consonants, or missing vowel sounds, since those are not indicated by the Makasar script. It does, however, handle consonant reduplication when signalled by <i class="foreign">angka</i> or doubled vowel-signs.</p>
<p>I was unable to make a functional webfont from MakasarGraphite, which is the only font I know of for Makasar, so you will need to <a href="https://github.com/pandey/graphite-fonts">download the font</a> for the picker to work correctly. Even then, because this is a Graphite font, it will only work on Firefox. Also note that Makasar code points are not officially assigned until Unicode 11 is released. </p>
<p>See the <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/makasar/help/">help file</a> for more information.</p>

          <p>A new <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/cherokee/">Cherokee Character Picker</a> web app is now available. The picker allows you to produce or analyse 
            runs of  text using the Cherokee script. Character pickers are 
            especially useful for people who don’t know a script well, as characters
            are arranged in ways that aid identification.</p>
          <p>The picker supports both uppercase and lowercase letters. Click on the <samp>Shift</samp> button to switch between them.</p>
          <p>The default selection panel reflects the syllabic sounds of Cherokee. If you select <samp>S</samp> in the vertical grey bar, the selection panel changes to show letters  arranged based on (broad) similarity to ASCII characters. This may help people unfamiliar with the Cherokee script to find characters.</p>

          <p>Version 20 is the first time all the pickers share the same template. It comes with a few new features worth mentioning.</p>
          <p><img src="imgs/picker-topleft-icons.png" alt="Icons at the top left of the text area."/></p>
          <p><b class="leadin">New text area icons.</b> The icons on the left above the input box allow you (listing them from left to right) to copy the text to the clipboard, select the text, and delete it. The other icons on the line are new. The box with the arrow generates a URL  - if you send the URL to someone and they click on it, they will see what you see in the text box. The plus sign adds some sample text to the text area, so you can play around with the controls, or just see what the script looks like. The blue circle opens the associated help file. </p>
          <p>The help text is in a separate location in v20, rather than under a reveal at the bottom of the page. This allows for easier reading. There's also a picture of the picker; click on a feature to jump to a description.</p>
          <p>The small L only appears on a couple of pickers. It turns any bicameral text in the text area into uniform lowercase.</p>
          <p><img src="imgs/picker-direction-setting.png" alt="Direction-setting icons below the text area."/></p>
          <p><b class="leadin">Direction arrows.</b> The set of arrows immediately below the text area, on the right, appear for scripts normally written right-to-left. They allow you to set the direction of the text area to LTR, auto, and RTL, respectively.</p>
          <p><b class="leadin">Example generator</b>. The feature that generates an example (<samp>Make example</samp>) now outputs the transliteration before IPA transcription (ie. the order is reversed). This seemed to make more sense, as it keeps the transliteration closer to the actual native text. (This may not be reflected yet in all the help files.)</p>
          <p><b class="leadin">Smallprint.</b> The smallprint line at the very bottom of the picker page now has links to the GitHub commit list for the picker, and a link that generates a new GitHub issue for any comments you want to make.</p>
          <p><b class="leadin">Other pickers.</b> Finally, there's a reveal at the bottom of the page to let you link to other pickers quickly.</p>
